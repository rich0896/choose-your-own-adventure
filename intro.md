# INTRO

 You wake up confused. You do not recognize where you are, and you have no memory of how you arrived here. It appears to be a small circular room, with many hallways leading out of it in every direction. Some of the hallways are emitting a colourful glow. One hallway is pitch black, and appears to have a high-pitched hum coming from the end of it. What do you do?
