# YOU ADVANCE TOWARD THE FAINT RED LIGHT

Your footsteps echo hollowly as you venture deeper into the corridor. The drone you heard before has grown into a low, menacing rumble, rattling in your bones with every step. The red glow ahead flickers erratically, casting long, twisting shadows on the walls. You catch glimpses of strange etchings—symbols that seem to wriggle across the stone whenever the bloody light illuminates them.

The air is thick and suffocating, tinged with a smell like old decay. You fight the urge to gag as your stomach clenches. There’s a sense of *wrongness* here, as though your very presence in this place is an affront to something ancient—and malevolent.

You reach a massive iron door that pulses with faint crimson light. Carvings of contorted figures cover its surface, all frozen in poses of terror. A high-pitched whisper pierces your ears, words you don’t understand but that fill your mind with a nameless dread. Despite every instinct screaming at you to turn back, you press your hand against the cold metal.

A surge of agony explodes through your body. It’s as if a thousand needles are being driven into your skin from within. The iron door seems to melt away, revealing a swirling mass of darkness that oozes out, taking form. A pair of glowing red eyes materialize, burning with an ancient rage. Your heart hammers in your chest as a cruel, rasping laugh fills the corridor.

Before you can scream, a searing tendril lashes out from the mass of shadows. It coils around you, crushing the breath from your lungs. Your vision blurs, and the last thing you see is that twisted silhouette looming over you. A voice—gravelly and triumphant—hisses in your ear:

> "You have wandered too far..."

Pain splinters through every nerve. Then everything goes black.

You have died.
