# YOU WALK DOWN THE DARK HALLWAY

As you walk down the hallway, you are swallowed by darkness. The light from the circular room fades behind you, and your other senses sharpen in response to the overwhelming blackness. The gentle hum you heard before becomes a constant drone, resonating in your ears.

You place a hand on the cool, damp wall to guide yourself. The floor beneath your feet is uneven, and every step feels like it could be your last if you misjudge where to place your foot. The air is musty and stale, carrying the hint of something metallicâ€”rust, perhaps, or old machinery left to rot in the shadows.

After several careful steps, you pause. A low, throbbing pulse seems to reverberate through the walls, almost as if the corridor itself were alive and breathing. Ahead, you swear you see the faintest flicker of light, tinted with a sickly red hue. Or is it just your eyes adjusting to the dark?

A drop of water falls from the ceiling onto your shoulder, making you flinch. You realize just how tense you are. Your heart pounds in your chest, and your fingers tremble slightly against the cold stone.

**What do you do?**
