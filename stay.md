# YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE

You decide to stay put in the circular room, keeping an eye on the hallways. The silence feels heavy, like the space itself is holding its breath. After a while, the walls seem to pulse faintly, almost like the room is alive. Then, out of nowhere, a voice echoes softly: "You can’t stay here forever. Time doesn’t work the way you think it does."
