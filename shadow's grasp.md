# my new story
You walk deeper into the hallway, the darkness wrapping around you like a suffocating veil. The hum you heard earlier has transformed into a low, steady thrum, vibrating through the walls and into your chest. The metallic tang in the air grows sharper, biting at your senses with every breath. Behind you, the faint light of the circular room is now a distant memory, leaving you completely immersed in the void ahead.

Your hand brushes against the wall, cold and slick, guiding you over the uneven, treacherous ground. Each step feels deliberate, your ears straining to catch any sound beyond the rhythmic pulse reverberating around you.

Then, a flicker—a faint, sickly red light—appears ahead. It pulses irregularly, casting fleeting shadows that ripple unnaturally. You stop to focus on it, unsure if it’s a beacon or a warning.

Suddenly, a sound disrupts the silence: a faint, rhythmic tapping from ahead, followed by a dragging noise, like something heavy being pulled across the floor. The noises grow louder, more deliberate, each one sending chills down your spine.

You glance back, but the darkness is absolute. The red light pulses again, brighter now, casting strange shapes in the distance. The tapping stops. The silence that follows feels louder than the noise itself.

Do you press forward toward the red light, or do you retreat into the suffocating blackness behind you?
